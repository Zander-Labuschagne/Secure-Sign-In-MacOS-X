# Secure-Sign-In-MacOS-X
This is a macOS version of my Secure Sign In application which can be found at https://github.com//Zander-Labuschagne/Secure-Sign-In.

This project is discontinued because I am using my Java version instead.
This repository includes the Xcode project.

The logo and name on the application comes from an iWorks template, it is not a registered company name or logo, I just added it to make it look cool.
